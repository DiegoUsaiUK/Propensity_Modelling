# Propensity Modelling - Using h2o and DALEX to Estimate the Likelihood of Purchasing a Financial Product

In this day and age, a business that leverages data to understand the drivers of its customers' behaviour has a true competitive advantage. Organisations can dramatically improve their performance in the market by analysing customer level data in an effective way and focus their efforts towards those that are more likely to engage. 

One trialled and tested approach to tease out this type of insight is [__Propensity Modelling__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling), which combines information such as a __customersâ€™ demographics__ (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), __psycho-graphic__ (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics), __engagement__ (emails opened, emails clicked, searches on mobile app, webpage dwell time, etc.), __user experience__ (customer service phone and email wait times, number of refunds, average shipping times), and __user behaviour__ (purchase value on different time-scales, number of days since most recent purchase, time between offer and conversion, etc.) to estimate the likelihood of a certain customer profile to performing a certain type of behaviour (e.g. the purchase of a product).

Once you understand the probability of a certain customer to interact with your brand, buy a product or a sign up for a service, you can use this information to create scenarios, be it minimising __marketing expenditure__, maximising __acquisition targets__, and optimise __email send frequency__ or __depth of discount__.

## Project Structure

In this project I'm analysing the results of a bank __direct marketing campaign__ to sell term deposits in order to identify what type of customer is more likely to respond. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls and more than one contact to the same client was required at times. 

__In the first part__, I am going to carry out an __extensive data exploration__ and use the results and insights to prepare the data for analysis. 

__In the second part__, I'm __estimating a number of models__ and assess their performance and fit to the data using a __model-agnostic methodology__ that enables to __compare traditional "glass-box" models and "black-box" models__. 

__In the third and last part__, I'll fit a __final model__ that combines findings from the exploratory analysis and insight from models' selection and use it to __run a revenue optimisation__.
